# Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Practical-Assignment
## This Repository contains the Jupyter Noteboook Numpy.Random package.ipynb
## In order to run Jupyter Notebook one must call the Jupyter Notebook command from within Python or the command line, I use the Cmder program.
## Intermittently within GitHib there seems to be a problem rendering Notebook ipynb files, in this situation I have used https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

Problem statement
The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python [2]. You are
required to create a Jupyter [5] notebook explaining the use of the package, including
detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.
There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook.
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.
