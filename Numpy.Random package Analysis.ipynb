    "Pseudorandom number generators are computer software packages that create numbers which appear to be random but in reality are predictable when the algorithm used to create these values is known. Computers are deterministic machines which means that their functions can be predictable and repeatable. This can be troublesome in the persuit of generating truely random numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Truely random number sequences can be generated by means of measuring the background radiation as it occurs in nature or other such processes. To avail of this truely random number generation, computer manufacturers would have to incorporate extra hardware and software into the design and assembly of their products, in order to measure this background radiation. This is not practical for a number of reasons, finacial reasons, efficiency, product size constraints etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this issue these generators make use of mathematical operations, series and special operators called \"seeds\". A seed is the key component in the generation of random numbers (a lot of computers use the state of the computer system as the seed, such as the time on the computer that the generator was run). Depending on what type of pseudorandom number generator being used, the seed feeds into a specified mathematical operation, such as the middle squares method or an operation that includes the apparent infinite series of decimals in the number \"pi\".\n",

    "The result is a pseudorandom number or pseudorandom sequence of numbers depending on the mathematical operation. The seed is the crutial aspect in the generation of pseudorandom numbers. If the seed and the mathematical operation is known the pseudorandom numbers generated can be replicated, by anyone. Pseudorandom number generators are often used in cryptography, to encrypt messages and keep important data secure when being transmitted via the internet. To do this seeds have become extremely long and complicated so that it is next to impossible to crack the encryption, in any reasonable length of time. An interesting and informative youtube video from the Khan Academy, explaining the theory behind the generation of pseudorandom numbers can be found below...[ref.]"
